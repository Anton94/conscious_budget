* Implement intelligent reminder systems to encourage consistent usage patterns

## **2.2 Target Platforms**

The application will be developed for multiple platforms to ensure maximum accessibility:

* iOS Mobile Application (App Store distribution)  
* Android Mobile Application (Google Play Store distribution)  
* Web Application (browser-based access)  
* Cross-platform code sharing of 80-90% between platforms

# **3\. Technical Architecture**

The ConsciousBudget application employs a modern, distributed architecture that emphasizes client-side processing, offline-first design principles, and seamless cloud integration. The system is built on a foundation of proven technologies that ensure scalability, maintainability, and cross-platform compatibility.

## **3.1 Frontend Layer**

Technology Stack:

* React Native for iOS and Android native applications  
* React Native Web for browser-based deployment  
* Shared component library ensuring 80-90% code reuse  
* Modern JavaScript (ES6+) with TypeScript support  
* Responsive design principles for multiple screen sizes

## **3.2 Backend Services**

The application utilizes a serverless architecture, leveraging Google's cloud services for authentication and data storage without maintaining proprietary backend infrastructure.

* Google OAuth 2.0 for secure user authentication  
* Google Drive API for data storage and synchronization  
* No proprietary server infrastructure required  
* RESTful API integration patterns for external services

## **3.3 Local Storage Systems**

* AsyncStorage for mobile platforms (iOS/Android)

# **4\. Functional Requirements**

The following functional requirements define the core capabilities and features that the ConsciousBudget application must provide to meet user needs and business objectives.

## **4.1 Expense Management**

### **4.1.2 Expense Categorization**

The system shall provide a comprehensive categorization framework supporting both predefined and user-defined categories with hierarchical organization capabilities.

| Category | Subcategories |
| :---- | :---- |
| Housing | Mortgage/Rent, Taxes, Household repairs, Home improvements, Security systems |
| Utilities | Electricity, Water/Sewer, Gas/Heating, Internet, Phone/Mobile, Cable/Streaming |
| Vehicle | Payment, Insurance, Fuel, Maintenance, Fees, Parking fees |
| Public Transport | Bus/Train/Subway fares, Rideshare/Taxi, Tolls |
| Food & Dining | Groceries, Restaurants, Coffee shops, Fast food, Work lunches, Delivery |
| Healthcare | Insurance premiums, Medical visits, Dental care, Prescriptions, Medical devices |
| Personal Care | Haircuts/Salon, Cosmetics, Clothing, Shoes, Dry cleaning |
| Entertainment | Movies/Theater, Concerts, Sports events, Books, Games, Subscriptions |
| Shopping | General merchandise, Electronics, Home goods, Online shopping, Gifts |
| Travel | Flights, Hotels, Car rentals, Travel meals, Activities, Travel insurance |
| Family & Children | Childcare, School supplies, Children's activities, Baby supplies |
| Pets | Pet food, Veterinary care, Pet supplies, Pet insurance, Grooming |

For each category allow the user to duplicate it and add additional label to it. 

For example, Housing category. The user can mark more than one Housing categories, let’s say two. Housing (Main house) and Housing (Vacation home).  The subcategories will become as follows: Mortgage/Rent (Main house), Taxes (Main house), Household repairs (Main house), Home improvements (Main house), Security systems (Main house) AND Mortgage/Rent, (Vacation home). Taxes (Vacation home)., Household repairs (Vacation home)., Home improvements, (Vacation home). Security systems (Vacation home).  
The Housing category and it’s subcategories stays as a common parent categories for the newly created Housing (Main house) and Housing (Vacation home) categories. The final hierarchical structure of the Housing category is as follows: Housing category is a parent category of both, Housing (Main house) and Housing (Vacation home). All the subcategories of Housing, e.g.  Taxes is parent of the subcategories of Taxes (Main house) and Taxes (Vacation home). 

The APP should allow the user to make arbitrary number of nested categories.
